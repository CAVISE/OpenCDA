# Welcome to OpenCDA

OpenCDA is a generalized framework for developing and testing **cooperative driving automation applications** (e.g., cooperative perception, platooning) as well as **autonomous vehicle components** (e.g., perception, localization, planning, control) using **multi-resolution simulators** (CARLA, SUMO).

> **Note**: This is a fork of the original OpenCDA project.
