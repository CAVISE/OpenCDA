To train FPV-RCNN efficiently, it is recommended to first train first stage and then train the whole network.
An example training schedule could be:
1. Train stage1 for 20 epochs: use opencood/hypes_yaml/fpvrcnn_intermediate_fusion.yaml as reference, make sure that stage2 is inactive
```yaml
model:
  args:
    activate_stage2: False
```

2. Train stage1 and stage2 for another 20 epochs: set ```activate_stage2``` to ```True```, resume parameters from step 1 and train futher.

The provided model is trained for 40 epochs in total.
