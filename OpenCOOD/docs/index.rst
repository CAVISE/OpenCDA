Welcome to OpenCOOD's documentation!
===================================
.. note::
   This is a fork of the original OpenCOOD project, integrated within the CAVISE OpenCDA framework.

   **Original OpenCOOD**: `DerrickXuNu/OpenCOOD <https://github.com/DerrickXuNu/OpenCOOD>`_
OpenCOOD is an open-source cooperative detection framework for autonomous driving. It provides SOTA cooperative detection algorithms,
convenient APIs for the large-scale simulated V2V perception dataset `OPV2V <https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/opv2v/>`_, and a set of useful tools for log replay.

In collaboration with `OpenCDA <https://github.com/ucla-mobility/OpenCDA>`_ , OpenCOOD is mainly focus on offline cooperative perception training and testing. If you are
interested in online cooperative perception and the corresponding closed-loop simulation test, OpenCDA will be the best tool.

OpenCOOD is a work in progress. Many features on the roadmap are being continuously developed. We welcome your contribution and please visit our Github repo
for the latest release.
